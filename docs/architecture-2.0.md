# GlobalFolkGames — Architecture 2.0 (FINAL DRAFT for review — NOT built yet)

Scope: a gasless, **fully on-chain**, people-to-people native-game arena. Earn = P2P / P2C / Leverage only. No "earn competitions", no local/international split, no subsidized pools. The existing M1-M11 architecture (shipped modules, seams, universal folders, identity = GFG handle) is preserved and is the foundation; v2 rebuilds the M1 game core around multiplayer + matched play, and layers the earn rails on the same seams.

## 0. Principles (non-negotiable)
1. **Everything that is money/trust lives on-chain.** Pools, locks, boards, winners, fees, payouts, margin, stop-losses. There is no hidden off-chain state that affects value.
2. **Gasless for the player.** They never sign per action or feel fees. The embedded Dynamic wallet silently signs; the ER does the execution.
3. **About the "relay" (honest answer to your question):** a server-side *signer* is unavoidable in every system, because a private key must live somewhere and 'watching' an inbox/settling at a trigger is off-chain automation. What we guarantee: the relay **never holds or controls value**; every action it takes is a signed on-chain transaction anyone can verify (payments, credits, escrow releases, payouts). Its only authority is what the program's rules give it (admin/creator gates), and the contract's on-chain state is the single source of truth. There is no off-chain ledger, balance, or hidden rule.
4. **Base layer only where required**: funding a match/pool, withdrawing to a wallet, one-time initialize/delegate. Everything else ER (gasless).
5. No token, no resellable NFT, no VC. Early-backer contributions are escrowed on-chain with time-based profit-share claims (see §7).

## 1. M1 v2 — Game core with multiplayer
- Rebuild M1 around **multiplayer** while keeping the M2 result seam: every game emits `publishGameResult` exactly as today.
- Modes (per game): **Solo** (you vs computer/human seats, free, points only) and **Multiplayer** (abbreviated 2mp, 3mp, 4mp... = the number of HUMAN wallets in the match, earn-capable). There are NOT two versions of a game: the single game build powers both - Solo just has no money+AGM attached. Per-game seat capacity is dynamic (Ludo supports 2-seat or 4-seat; Monopoly 5-8 seats; etc.), so '2p/4p' (seat count within Ludo) is never confused with 'mp' (how many humans).
- Earn fill rules: an earn match fills 2..N human wallets via AGM; if not enough humans accept within the window, the remaining SEATS get a labelled (Computer) seat only when the mode is P2C-allowed (player can reject).
- Deterministic game logic + **on-chain board/move state** for any match that involves value (could be heavy; we ship move-hashes + committed board snapshots at checkpoints; final settlement on-chain). Confirm with MagicBlock ER limits during build (see §9).
- Turn clocks + match time caps enforced by the program/time service (§4).

## 2. Earn engines (2-in-1, CEX bank + DEX community)
- **P2C (platform computer, CEX-like "bank"):** the platform funds a pool of computer seats so matches always have a counterpart. Opponents are always labelled `(Computer)` vs `(Human)` with skill band; players accept/reject. Platform publishes the reward formula and takes its fee from the finished pool.
- **P2P (player vs player):** the **Automated Game Matcher (AGM, invented by Solomon Foskaay)** matches open orders. Player posts an order ($1..$1,000 stake), AGM matches a counterpart (2-way; N-way up to 20 for tournaments), both approve (profile/rating visible, reject allowed), escrow locks both stakes, game runs, the published split pays winners. AGM matches only; money is player-to-player.
- **Leverage (prop-style):** player posts collateral; the bank extends X multiples on a declared **stop-loss floor**; auto stop is executed on-chain. Player can only lose their collateral; the platform's exposure is capped by the risk floor and a per-round fee. Phase-2 (needs banker accounting + on-chain stop execution).
- **P2C break-even - CORRECTED, honest answer (owner 2026-08-25):** flat 10% fee on the POT. Two sides stake S each -> pot 2S -> winner gets 1.8S, loser 0. If the platform is the computer side: computer WIN -> +0.8S; computer LOSE -> -S (it loses its full stake). EV per match = S x (1.8w - 1). Break-even when w = 1/1.8 = **55.6%** (a computer must win MORE than half its matches for the bank to break even). If players study and beat a mid computer, the house DOES bleed - exactly the owner's fear, and it is CORRECT.
- **Mitigations that make P2C survivable WITHOUT rigging:**
  1. **P2C is the availability filler, never the profit center.**

  > On-chain (arc2m7c, built): `P2cBank` ONE shared cross-game pool (`[gfgp2cbank]`): capital pool, GMT day bucket, signed day-net, day-loss cap (default $20) that pauses the bank for the day, win/loss/trades counters. `p2c_fund` top-up, `p2c_settle` applies one computer-seat result from a locked settlement exactly once (`AgmSettlement.status` 0->1, additive trailing field on the v1 layout) with the $1-$10 small-stake band enforced on-chain. Net math = computer win `+(payout - stake)`, computer loss `-stake` (2-seat $5: win +$4, loss -$5, EV as spec). Real revenue = P2P fees (zero house exposure - players pay each other, platform takes 10% of the pot). P2C exists so matches always fill.
  2. **Computers only fill seats when no human counterpart is ready**, capped at SMALL stakes ($1-$10) so even a bad day costs little.
  3. **Strong-but-fair computer (~65-70% win band)** for new/small-stake seats - skill, not rigging (no per-hand switching); clearly labelled '(Computer · Strong)'.
  4. **Anti-farm:** a wallet that clearly beats the computer gets steered to P2P/unranked + a rematch cap per wallet/week; the bank pauses for the day on a net-loss cap.
  5. Community liquidity is PHASE-2, only after live data proves bank EV, with the loss-protection floor + caps (§1).
- Fees: FLAT 10% of each finished pot for every earn match, all modes, all games (one number everywhere, printed up front). Premium plans stay as the separate comfort/gas subscription (lives, points, ad-free, booster, bigger daily).

## 3. Match rules / anti-abuse (all earn modes)
- Max match time: 30 min (2p) / 45 min (3p) / 60 min (4p+), per-game override.
- Max turn time per game (e.g., Ludo 60s): idle → the turn passes / auto-moves per game logic; stalling impossible.
- No cancel on loss: once stakes lock, only a rules draw or platform-infra refund ends it.
- Reputation/rating per game, visible to match parties; computers carry a fixed band label.

## 4. Payments & payouts (crypto-first, honest)
- **Solana-first (beta):** pay with the user's embedded Dynamic SOL wallet or any external wallet; **Solana Pay / SPL transfer (USDC/USDT/SOL)** to the sponsor key, with a memo order id. Instant on-chain credit of premium points/upgrade to the **same embedded wallet** the site reads (existing Upgrade flow completes it). Low/near-zero fees, global, no business-registration gate. EVM stablecoins (USDC) later via Dynamic embedded EVM wallet.
- Payouts: on-chain (to the player's embedded/wallet), or escrow release to winners; small amounts batched/credited as points when on-chain transfer economics would eat the value.

## 5. Platform money model (sustainability — earn is NOT subsidized)
- Revenue: match fees (5–20%), Premium plans, competitive entry (S point or S-credit), affiliate 20%, later merch/ads/escrow.
- Earn pools come from players (P2P escrow) or the platform P2C bank's own capital; no grants to keep competitions going.
- Devnet launch: everyone plays free (devnet SOL is free) to prove the pipeline; mainnet funding via early-backer escrow or grants (Solana Foundation / MagicBlock) with fully on-chain accounting.

## 6. On-chain inventory needed (build list, all additive)
- Escrow match vault per game/players (`[gfgms, …]`), order book / AGM state, settlement + fee split.
- P2C bank + risk caps account.
- Turn-clock + match-time commit.
- Leverage margin + on-chain stop (Phase-2).
- Winners → player points/ledger + optional direct USDC payout.
- No changes to existing M3-M11 seeds/layouts.

## 7. Early backer (no token, no resellable NFT)
- $100–$500 contributions toward the ~100 SOL mainnet runway via on-chain escrow; backers get 1–3 years of highest membership + a percentage share of platform revenue over that band, claimable (daily/weekly/monthly) on-chain; distribution ends at the term. Uses the same on-chain accounting/escrow so every income stream is traceable.

## 8. What does NOT change in v2
M1-M11 seams & universal folders, GFG-handle identity, ER-gassless-first, base-layer rules, homepage anti-copy wording, Beta badge, tooling/run-sheet, brand colors, no-token stance; the old earn competition module (M7 launch) is **retired from v2** (superseded by the AGM engines).

## 9. Research to confirm before/while building
- MagicBlock ER: limits on arbitrary read/simple state per tx; whether on-chain board snapshots per turn are affordable vs commit-hash+checkpoint.
- Solana Pay + SPL transfer for payments; memo binding; balances on-chain.
- Token-2022 for USDC/USDT; base-layer settlement for escrow/payoffs.
- AMM/impermanent-loss literature for the P2C bank (already summarized in §2) and on-chain stop mechanics for leverage.

## 10. Open decisions before we build (want your picks)
1. Fee table (default: \$1-\$10=10%, \$10-\$100=7%, \$100+\$1000=5% — confirm or set your own).
2. P2C computer difficulty bands & whether the bank must net-break-even per month.
3. Keep Premium plans separate from match fees (recommendation: yes).
4. Competitive entry: keep S-credit entry or drop to reduce P2P friction.
5. Funding: early-backer escrow vs grants-first vs both.
6. Multiplayer real-time latency target (e.g., cross-turn ≤ 5s) and whether any game ships P2P at launch or solo+P2C first.

Finalize these six and the doc becomes the build guide; we start the M1 v2 rebuild (multiplayer + AGM seams) from there.

## M1 v2 MODULE SPEC (APPROVED BY OWNER 2026-08-25 - the build contract)
> Build order locked in this turn: (1) on-chain board + move commit [ITEM D] -> (2) AGM lobby + P2P match lock -> (3) clocks/timeouts -> (4) P2C bank binding -> (5) settle/fee. Flat 10% pot fee. Modes = Solo (free, unchanged) vs Multiplayer (N human wallets, earn-capable); one game build serves both; per-game seat capacity dynamic. Solo/non-earn play must never regress.

### Summary
M1 v2 = the multiplayer native-game core. Every game keeps the existing M2 result seam, but the game core now also supports 3 play modes: **Solo** (vs computer, free, points only), **Multiplayer** (AGM-matched real players; match-code for private games), **P2C** (AGM-matched computer, earn). Deterministic moves are committed on-chain (board snapshot checkpoints + move hashes; full board replay on chain for earn games where affordable, ER permitting). Turn-clock + match-time are enforced. Identity = GFG handle (never name/email/wallet).

### expectedInput (what M1 v2 receives)
- FROM M2 SEAM: the normalized `gfg:game-result@1` envelope (seat/actor/position, proof sig, finishedAt) - unchanged, games keep emitting it.
- FROM THE LOBBY/AGM MODULE (new): match config `{ mode, players:[{wallet,handle,rating}], poolUsdCents/stake, ruleset, clocks, escrowRef }`. Earn matches only start when escrow (AGM) confirms funds are locked.
- FROM M5 (plans): allowed-tier gate for earn modes (mirror of competition tier gating).
- FROM GAME RUNTIME: per-turn state checkpoints `{ matchRef, turn, hash }` the game posts to the on-chain board.

### expectedOutput (what M1 v2 exposes)
- `publishGameResult` completes as today PLUS additive fields: `mode`, `players[]` (handle + wallet), `stake/PoolUsdCents`, `escrowRef` so M3 (local points), M4 (global), and the earn engines can consume without reading game internals.
- On-chain board records per match: participants, committed move checkpoints, turn times, final result → readable by M3/M4/AGM/escrow for rewards, fees and dispute checks.
- A `matchState(matchRef)` API (relay) returning participants/rules/timers so the AGM + escrow lock and settle deterministically.

### Dependencies/order
Build M1 v2 in this order: (1) on-chain board + move commit instruction; (2) AGM lobby + P2P match lock; (3) clocks/timeouts; (4) P2C bank binding; (5) settle/fee. Solo/non-earn play keeps working with zero changes (existing seams).

## M6 v2 AFFILIATE (automated instant payout — owner 2026-08-25)
- Replace the manual monthly settle with an **atomic on-chain split at payment time**: when a paying upgrade/subscription/booster purchase finalizes, the program credits **80% to the platform wallet** and **20% to the referrer's embedded wallet instantly** (premium points/ledger), all in one transaction. No manual worker, no monthly batch, no admin payout step.
- Referral pairs are already recorded on-chain at signup (affiliate module present, M6). Only the payment seat for the referred first-paid purchase triggers the split; subsequent paying months keep splitting the same way (they are still "this purchase pays the referrer").
- If no referrer: 100% to the platform wallet. Non-refundable policy stays and is shown.
- Fees journey: pay → split (80 platform / 20 referrer) → buyer's premium points credited (existing 5,000/10,000/500P flow) → Upgrade page completes activation.

## Arc 2.0 MODULE MAP & SLICE NAMING (LOCKED — owner 2026-08-25)
> RULE: each module numbers its OWN slices starting at 'a' (arc2m1a, arc2m1b, ...; arc2m7a, arc2m7b, ...). A module never continues another module's letters. Builds can hop modules in any order that fits (arc2m1a -> arc2m7a -> arc2m7b -> arc2m1b) but the per-module alphabet is always clear.
Slice labels are always `arc2m<N><slice>` so it is ALWAYS obvious which module a build belongs to.

| Slice | Module (v2) | Owns |
|---|---|---|
| arc2m1a ✅ | M1 Game core | multiplayer Solo/Multiplayer, on-chain board + move commit, per-game rules profiles (registry) |
| arc2m7a ✅ | M7 AGM (Matchmaker & Escrow) | standalone game-agnostic order book: post/cancel/match |
| arc2m7b ✅ | M7 AGM | escrow lock + settle (flat 10% pot fee: winner 90%, house 10%) |
| arc2m7c ✅ | M7 AGM | P2C computer bank + anti-farm caps |
| arc2m1b ✅ | M1 Game core | per-game timeouts: per-seat clocks, timeout->forfeit, finish_forfeit |

> **arc2m7c (built, deployed, smoke PASS):** `P2cBank` account per game ([gfgp2c, game]): capital pool, GMT day bucket, signed day-net, day-loss cap (default $20) pauses the bank for the day, win/loss/trades counters. `p2c_fund` top-up (init_fresh seeds real defaults on a zeroed bank), `p2c_settle` applies one computer-seat result from a locked settlement exactly once (AgmSettlement.status 0->1) with the $1-$10 small-stake band enforced on-chain. Net math = computer win `+(payout - stake)`, computer loss `-stake` (2-seat $5: win +$4, loss -$5, EV as spec). Smoke: fund $1000, lose $5, win $4 -> dayNet -$1, trades 2, bank open.

> **arc2m1b (built, deployed, smoke PASS):** `MatchClock` account per match ([gfgclock, game, match_ref]) keeps the board game-agnostic: per-seat deadlines snapshotted from the board's turn_secs. `start_match_clocks` inits (only this may create - an empty clock cannot forfeit), `touch_seat_clock` resets a seat's deadline after a legal move, `timeout_seat` is permissionless anti-stall (records a stall, resets the window, at timeout_cap=3 marks the seat FORFEITED), `finish_forfeit` lets a healthy seat finalize the board when another seat forfeited (the forfeited seat can never claim the win). Solo boards never create a clock, so the free path is untouched.

M7 keeps the existing v1 modules untouched: M2 seam, M3/M4 points, M5 plans, M6 affiliate (now auto 20/80), M10 lives/daily, M11 community. Good the old earn-competition M7 is RETIRED; the slot reopens as the AGM module.

### M7 (AGM) expectedInput / expectedOutput
- **expectedInput:** gameId chosen by the maker (from the games registry), order stake, seats; a matched `taker` signer; a board (M1) `match_ref` when locked; `registry rules[gameId]` for seats/turn/match caps; M2 result envelope at finish.
- **expectedOutput:** on-chain order lifecycle (open/matched/locked/cancelled); escrow lock; settle outputs `potUsdCents`, `feeUsdCents` (10%), `winnerSeat`, `payoutUsdCents` (90%); game-agnostic - any game plugs in by picking a gameId from the registry.

Build policy: any capability that is shared across games (matchmaking, escrow, fees, identity, payments) lives in a UNIVERSAL module (M7 AGM here), never inside a game. If a slice doesn't fit its module's inputs/outputs, the ARCHITECTURE changes first, then the build follows (never the reverse).

### HOW IT WORKS IN PLAIN WORDS (read this first, then the technical deltas above)

Think of the earn arena like a small bank with a betting window. This is the whole arc in one story, using the REAL numbers our devnet tests produced.

**1. Posting an order (arc2m7a).** You "write a ticket": your game (Ludo), your stake ($5), and how many seats. The ticket is stored on Solana, not on our server. Test result: a ticket gets an owner line, a stake line, a seat count, and a status line that starts at "open".

**2. Matching (arc2m7a).** Another player (or the computer bank) says "I take this ticket". Now both sides are locked in at $5 each. Test result: the same wallet CANNOT take its own ticket, the taker must be a different wallet.

**3. Lock + settle (arc2m7b).** When the match finishes, the pot is split:
- Pot = stake x seats. Two humans at $5 each = a $10 pot.
- House fee = 10% of the pot = $1.
- Winner gets the rest = $9 (90% of the pot).
Real test numbers on-chain: pot $10, fee $1, payout $9, winner seat 0. One number for every game, everywhere, so players always see the same math.

**4. The computer bank (arc2m7c).** To make sure matches always fill, the platform keeps a computer ("the bank") that takes empty seats, but only on small stakes ($1-$10) and with guard rails. Real test on devnet: we put $1000 in the bank, the computer lost a $5 seat (-$5) then won a $5 seat (+$4, because the winning computer gets its $9 payout minus the $5 it staked). Net for the day: a $1 loss on 2 trades. If the bank ever loses $20 or more in one GMT day it stops taking seats until the day turns over. That is the anti-meltdown switch.

**5. Turn clocks (arc2m1b).** Every seat gets a timer so nobody can stall a match forever. Real test: a seat with a 2-second turn stopped moving, got 3 timeout strikes, and was FORFEITED. Its attempt to claim the win was rejected, and the healthy seat finished and won. Solo play never uses these clocks, so free casual games stay exactly as they are today.

**6. The board (arc2m1a).** Moves are committed on-chain as hashes, so the whole match can be replayed and proven. The board knows money and seats; the game decides the rules. This is why a future game (Monopoly, Ayo Olopon) plugs in by picking a gameId, not by being rewritten.

In short: tickets (orders) -> match -> play on a provable board with timers -> lock the pot -> cut the 10% fee -> pay the 90% winner. Every step is on Solana, gasless for the player, and testable on devnet before any real money is involved.
